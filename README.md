# Introduction

Starter repository for Sorting Suite project. This repository includes directories for your work on Bubble, Insertion, and Merge sorts.

## Bubble Sort

Implement a `BubbleSort` class which will make the following code snippet work:

```ruby
sorter = BubbleSort.new
=> #<BubbleSort:0x007f81a19e94e8>
sorter.sort(["d", "b", "a", "c"])
=> ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
```

## Insertion Sort

Implement a `InsertionSort` class which will make the following code snippet work:

```ruby
sorter = InsertionSort.new
=> #<InsertionSort:0x007f81a19e94e8>
sorter.sort(["d", "b", "a", "c"])
=> ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
```

## Merge Sort

Implement a namespaced `MergeSort` class which will make the following code snippet work:

```ruby
sorter = MergeSort.new
=> #<MergeSort:0x007f81a19e94e8>
sorter.sort(["d", "b", "a", "c"])
=> ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
```
